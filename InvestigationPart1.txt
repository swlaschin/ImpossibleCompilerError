I opened up the source and did some debugging.

It fails in "let rec typeEnc g (gtpsType,gtpsMethod) ty" in file "TastOps.fs"
If fails because the {ty :TType} gets massivly broken to the point where the debugger will crash trying to inspect it.

There are a few functions {stripTyEqns,stripTyEqnsAndMeasureEqns} that modify the {ty} before the failure catch inside the function {typeEnc}.
But also likly the {ty} gets messed up befort {typeEnc} is called.

Maybe move this information to the main discription.
